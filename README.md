## Introduction
Pegasus is a set of modular functions and classes used for building generative AI applications. It provides light weight abstractions over concepts like agents, RAG, prompts, workflows e.t.c

The intention is to be a non-opininated set of functions for builing AI application (software applications where the core service uses artificial intelligence to accomplish its task).
